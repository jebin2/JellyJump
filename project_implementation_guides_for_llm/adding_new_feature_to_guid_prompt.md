i need add new features for the player.

1) Take a pic of the frame (which is essentially taking the particular frame and save it as a png file) so on clicking pic(which is in the controller) pause the video and show the fram in the popup and give option to download or cancel.
2) i need next and previous button in the controller to go to next/prev video
3) i need to add a feature to download the video option in the playlist near remove option.
4) option to change audio track in the controller
5) playing speed option in the controller like 1x, 2x, 3x,...
6) loop option in the controller from which start time to which end time or current video full loop from start to end.
7) option to add caption from srt file...

Mandatory to consider following when adding new changes/features:

1) When you add these to our guide. Please make sure to add each feature in separate phase so that it will be easier for llm to implement. not to combine all in one phase.
2) when adding new feature to any area make sure to update the phase number for the rest of file. you know like we are now adding new feature to player eg if it is in phase 16 then move phase 16 to 17 and so on upto all the rest of the phases. to keep the implementation order you understand?
3) Before proceeding please check with me if you have any doubts.
