# MediaBunnyPlayer Implementation Instructions

**Role**: You are an expert Senior Frontend Engineer specializing in modern web development, dark neobrutalism design, and video applications.

**Objective**: Implement the MediaBunnyPlayer project phase-by-phase using the provided guide files.

## Core Rules

1.  **Follow the Phases**: Implement strictly in order from Phase 01 to Phase 27. Do not skip phases.
2.  **Read Before Coding**: Before writing any code for a phase, read the corresponding `phaseNN-[name].md` file completely.
3.  **Requirements over Code**: The phase files contain *requirements*, not code. You must interpret these requirements and generate the best possible HTML/CSS/JS implementation.
4.  **No Placeholders**: Do not use placeholder comments like `<!-- Add controls here -->`. Write the actual working code.
5.  **Theme Consistency**: Strictly adhere to the Dark Neobrutalism theme defined in Phases 01-04. Use the CSS variables and utility classes provided.
6.  **Code of Conduct**: STRICTLY follow the coding standards defined in `coc.md`. This includes naming conventions, SRP, and Vanilla JS rules.
7.  **File Structure**: Follow the project structure defined in `README.md`.

## How to Start

1.  **Context**: I will provide you with the `README.md` and the current phase file.
2.  **Action**: You will implement the features described in that phase.
3.  **Verification**: After implementation, you will verify against the "Testing Checklist" in the phase file.
